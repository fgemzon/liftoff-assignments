## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Many individuals have a desire to volunteer, but it might seem daunting start the search process in general. This application creates connection between non-profit organizations and volunteers. Volunteers will be able to search specific qualities of a position, instead of going through individual non-profit organzation websites. From there the volunteer will be able to view the listings within their search terms and select one or more to apply to. Which then organization would be able to see the inviduals that have applied and be  able to accept or reject their services.

### Technologies
Java, springboot, mysql, hibernate, thymeleaf templates. 
### What I'll Have to Learn
I think that I would like to learn more css to make the user experience a little more pleasing. But it should still be on the simpler side, so it is easy for the user's and organization's experience with the application.
